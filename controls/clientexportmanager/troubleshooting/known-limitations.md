# Known Limitations



## Known Limitations

The **RadClientExportManager** control's known limitations are listed below:

* no support for RTL text

* no rendering of shadow DOM

* no CSS box-shadow, text-shadow, radial gradients (linear gradients are supported).

* only **solid** border-style

* the content of the following elements is not rendered: `<iframe>`, `<svg>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`. A `<canvas>` will be rendered as an image, but only if it's "non-tainted" (does not display images from another domain). An .svg image can be exported if its URL is set in the "src" attribute of an `<img>` element.

* rendering of `<select>` elements is imperfect (some minor issues can be noticed, like wrong padding or missing the drop down arrow). 

* images hosted on different domains might not be rendered, unless permissive [Cross-Origin HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image) are provided by the server. Similarly, fonts might not be possible to load cross-domain. Even with the proper CORS headers, IE9 will not be able to load images or fonts from another domain, and could raise a uncatcheable security exception. If you need to support IE9, make sure to host images and fonts on the same domain as the application.

* when the generated document is opened with Acrobat Reader and you try to use the **Save As** option from the file menu an error is thrown. "The document could not be saved. There was a problem reading(23)". The solution is to open Acrobat Reader options (Edit → Preferences) and in the "Documents" section uncheck “Save As optimizes for Fast Web View”, which is enabled by default. After this, **Save As** will work without errors.

* exporting images from another domain requires the server to have the following header in its response: **Access-Control-Allow-Origin: `*`**, which will enable cross-origin requests. If the server does not have this header set access to the image will be denied and it will not be exported.

* exporting font icons 

* exporting pseudo:elements borders (for example RadOrgChart connection lines)
